    <p>I am a woman with an attention to detail and effective project management
       skills. It has been apparent over the years in my studies at school. At a
        young age, I always knew that math and art would be my passions.
        However, I’ve always had to pick between the two which made my
        post-secondary choices difficult.
      <br>When it finally came down to which passion to pursue, I tried my hand
      at mathematics with a minor in computer science at Carleton University.
      Although, I was missing my artistic side far too much and took a leap of
      faith to change programs and schools. I wanted to incorporate my math and
      art skills into one subject of study. Thankfully, this decision was
      readily available to me.
      <br>I am currently at Algonquin College, working to familiarize myself
      with a number of  different areas of interest. My favourite aspects of
      graphic design have been web development and illustration so far. It has
      taken many hard choices to get to where I am today, and I couldn’t be
      happier.</p>
